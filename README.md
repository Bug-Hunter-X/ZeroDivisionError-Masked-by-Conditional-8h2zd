This repository demonstrates an uncommon Python error: a ZeroDivisionError masked by a conditional statement. The file 'bug.py' contains the erroneous code, which may not always raise the exception, making it harder to debug. The file 'bugSolution.py' offers a solution illustrating how to prevent this type of error.
